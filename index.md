### Neumann Networks
The Neumann Network is a method of solving ill-posed linear inverse
problems by learning a nonlinear regularizer, in the form of a deep
neural network. Specifically, the Neumann Network is designed to minimize
the following expression:


  $$argmin_\beta || X \beta - y||_2^2 + R(\beta)$$
